        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen.paper,or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><b style="text-decoration: line-through;">Css is not neccesary</b><span>CSS saves a lot of work.</span>it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>

    </ol>

    <h3><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h3>
<ul type="disk">
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
    <li>Internal - bye using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link elements to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>the most comman way to add CSS.is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span>this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate. and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>when comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>
<p>In CSS, selection are used to target a specific element or range of elements on web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element. </p>
<p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class an ID. Both are used to target elemnets to which a style should he applied.</p>
